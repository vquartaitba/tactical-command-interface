# Zkredit Protocol - Backend Infrastructure

### 🚀 **Our Solution: Zero-Trust, Cross-Chain Financial Identity**

We're building a **multi-blockchain architecture** where each network specializes in what it does best, creating a system that's more secure, efficient, and accessible than any single blockchain could be.

## 🏗️ **Architecture Deep Dive: Why This Multi-Chain Approach?**

### **1. Lisk Blockchain - The Orchestration Layer**

**What It Does**: Lisk serves as the main application layer, handling user identity management, cross-chain workflow orchestration, and Soulbound Token (SBT) issuance.

**Why Lisk?**
- **High Performance**: Lisk's DPoS consensus provides fast finality (2-3 seconds) and high throughput (15,000+ TPS)
- **Modular Architecture**: Built-in support for custom modules and sidechains, perfect for our evolving protocol needs
- **Developer Experience**: JavaScript/TypeScript SDK makes development faster and more accessible
- **Cost Efficiency**: Lower transaction costs compared to Ethereum mainnet
- **Ecosystem Maturity**: Established network with proven security and governance

**Our Implementation**:
- **Identity Contract**: Manages user registration, verification, and API permissions
- **ScoreSBT Contract**: Handles Soulbound Token minting with credit score metadata
- **Data Registry Contract**: Maintains whitelist of authorized data sources and types
- **Flare Integration**: Bridges cross-chain data verification with the protocol

### **2. Zama Network - The Confidential Computation Layer**

**What It Does**: Zama provides Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) capabilities, allowing AI models to compute on encrypted data without ever decrypting it.

**Why Zama & FHE?**
- **Privacy by Design**: Data remains encrypted throughout the entire computation process
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Meets GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulations automatically
- **AI Model Integration**: Enables sophisticated credit scoring without exposing sensitive financial data
- **Zero Knowledge**: Users can prove they meet credit criteria without revealing their actual financial details
- **Mathematical Security**: Based on lattice-based cryptography, resistant to quantum attacks

**Our Implementation**:
- **CreditScoreModel Contract**: FHE-enabled smart contract for credit score computation
- **Encrypted Data Processing**: Handles encrypted financial data from multiple sources
- **Model Flexibility**: Supports both simple scoring algorithms and complex AI models
- **Result Encryption**: Returns encrypted credit scores that only the user can decrypt

### **3. Flare Network - The Cross-Chain Data Verification Layer**

**What It Does**: Flare provides cryptographic attestations for real-world data, bridging Web2 and Web3 with verifiable proofs.

**Why Flare?**
- **State Connector Technology**: Enables smart contracts to securely access external data sources
- **Cross-Chain Interoperability**: Built specifically for connecting different blockchain networks
- **Data Attestation**: Provides cryptographic proofs that data hasn't been tampered with
- **Oracle Security**: Decentralized network of validators prevents single points of failure
- **Cost Efficiency**: Lower costs than traditional oracle solutions

**Our Implementation**:
- **FlareStateConnector**: Consumer contract that verifies Flare attestations
- **FlareIntegration**: Bridge contract connecting Flare with the Zkredit protocol
- **Data Validation**: Ensures financial data integrity before processing
- **Cross-Chain Communication**: Enables secure data flow between networks

### **4. Filecoin/IPFS - The Decentralized Storage Layer**

**What It Does**: Provides immutable, decentralized storage for metadata, cryptographic proofs, and user consent records.

**Why Filecoin/IPFS?**
- **Content Addressing**: Data is identified by its cryptographic hash, ensuring integrity
- **Decentralization**: No single point of failure or censorship
- **Cost Efficiency**: Significantly cheaper than traditional cloud storage
- **Permanence**: Data cannot be altered or deleted once stored
- **Global Distribution**: Content is distributed globally for better performance

**Our Implementation**:
- **Metadata Storage**: User consent records, verification proofs, and audit trails
- **Content Addressing**: All stored data referenced by IPFS Content Identifiers (CIDs)
- **Proof Preservation**: Cryptographic proofs stored immutably for verification
- **Audit Compliance**: Complete audit trail for regulatory and compliance purposes

2. **Identity Verification**: Protocol verifies identity through multiple sources
3. **Metadata Storage**: Identity data stored on Filecoin/IPFS with CID reference
4. **SBT Issuance**: Identity SBT minted on Lisk blockchain

### **Phase 2: Credit Score Request**
```
Fintech → FlareIntegration → FlareStateConnector → External APIs
```
1. **Fintech Request**: Authorized fintech requests credit score for registered user
2. **Data Verification**: Flare network queries authorized external APIs
3. **Attestation**: Flare validators provide cryptographic attestations
4. **Verification**: FlareStateConnector verifies attestation validity

### **Phase 3: AI Model Execution**
```
FlareIntegration → Cross-Chain Bridge → Zama Network → FHE Computation
```
1. **Cross-Chain Message**: Verified data sent to Zama network via bridge
2. **Encrypted Processing**: AI model processes encrypted financial data
3. **Score Computation**: Credit score computed using FHE without decryption
4. **Result Encryption**: Encrypted score returned to Lisk network

### **Phase 4: Score Finalization**
```
Zama Result → FlareIntegration → ScoreSBT Contract → Filecoin/IPFS
```
1. **Result Processing**: FlareIntegration receives encrypted credit score
2. **SBT Minting**: ScoreSBT contract mints Soulbound Token with score metadata
3. **Metadata Storage**: Complete audit trail stored on Filecoin/IPFS
4. **User Access**: User can now use their credit score for financial services

## 🛡️ **Security Architecture: Zero-Trust Design**

### **Cryptographic Security**
- **ECDSA Signatures**: All cross-chain messages signed and verified
- **Hash Verification**: Data integrity verified at every step
- **Chain ID Validation**: Prevents cross-chain replay attacks
- **Timestamp Controls**: Prevents stale data and replay attacks

### **Access Control**
- **Role-Based Permissions**: Different access levels for users, fintechs, and validators
- **Whitelist Management**: Only authorized entities can participate
- **Multi-Signature Requirements**: Critical operations require multiple approvals
- **Emergency Pause**: Contracts can be paused in emergency situations

### **Privacy Protection**
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Data encrypted from source to destination
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Users prove eligibility without revealing data
- **Data Minimization**: Only necessary data is collected and processed
