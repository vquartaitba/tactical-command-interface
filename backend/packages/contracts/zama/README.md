# Zama Smart Contracts

## Purpose

To serve as the confidential computation layer. Its sole function is to execute the credit scoring AI model on the user's data in a way that preserves 100% privacy.

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. AI Model Definition (CreditScoreModel.sol)
- Contains the logic of the machine learning model
- Implements algorithms like logistic regression, decision trees, or neural networks
- Written in Solidity to be executed on Zama's fhEVM (Fully Homomorphic Encryption EVM)

### 2. Execution on Encrypted Data
- Receives user data that is already encrypted by the Zama network upon entry
- Runs the AI model on these "ciphertexts" without ever decrypting the data
- Produces a result (the credit score) that is also encrypted
- Maintains complete privacy throughout the computation process

### 3. Result Return
- Sends the encrypted credit score back to the Lisk contract
- Uses cross-chain bridge for secure transmission
- Ensures the result remains encrypted until it reaches the user's wallet

## Key Technologies

- **Solidity**: Smart contract development for fhEVM
- **TFHE-sol**: Zama's library for Fully Homomorphic Encryption on EVM
- **FHE Operations**: Mathematical operations on encrypted data
- **Cross-Chain Messaging**: Secure communication with Lisk network

## Privacy Features

### Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)
- **Data Privacy**: User data remains encrypted throughout the entire computation
- **Model Privacy**: The AI model itself can be kept private if desired
- **Result Privacy**: Credit scores are encrypted until they reach authorized parties
- **Zero-Knowledge**: No information about the data or computation is leaked

### Security Guarantees
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Data is never decrypted on the Zama network
- **Mathematical Security**: Based on proven cryptographic hardness assumptions
- **Audit Trail**: All operations are verifiable while maintaining privacy

## Interactions

### External Dependencies
- **contracts/lisk**: Invoked by the identity contract on Lisk and returns results to it
- **Cross-Chain Bridge**: Facilitates secure communication between networks

### Isolation Principle
The Zama contracts have **no other external interactions** to ensure their isolation and security. This design principle:
- Minimizes attack surface
- Ensures predictable behavior
- Maintains privacy guarantees
- Simplifies security auditing

## AI Model Architecture

### Supported Algorithms
- **Linear Models**: Logistic regression, linear regression
- **Tree-Based Models**: Decision trees, random forests
- **Neural Networks**: Feed-forward networks with FHE-compatible activation functions

### Model Requirements
- **FHE Compatibility**: All operations must work on encrypted data
- **Deterministic**: Same input must always produce same output
- **Efficient**: Optimized for FHE computation costs
- **Auditable**: Model logic must be verifiable and transparent

## Performance Considerations

### FHE Overhead
- **Computation Cost**: FHE operations are computationally expensive
- **Gas Optimization**: Smart contract optimizations for cost efficiency
- **Batch Processing**: Support for processing multiple data points simultaneously
- **Caching**: Strategic use of on-chain storage for intermediate results

### Scalability
- **Parallel Processing**: Support for concurrent model executions
- **Resource Management**: Efficient allocation of computational resources
- **Queue Management**: Handling of multiple credit score requests

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality
- **Modular Design**: Clear separation of model logic and infrastructure
- **Extensive Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage for FHE operations
- **Documentation**: Clear documentation of all mathematical operations
- **Security Review**: Regular security audits and code reviews

### Deployment
- **Testnet Validation**: Thorough testing on Zama testnets
- **Gradual Rollout**: Phased deployment to mainnet
- **Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of performance and security
- **Upgradeability**: Support for model updates and improvements
