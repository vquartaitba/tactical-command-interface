# Cross-Chain Listener

## Purpose

To serve as an optional service for monitoring cross-chain messages and ensuring the integrity of the multi-chain communication within the Zkredit protocol.

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Cross-Chain Message Monitoring
- Monitors messages sent between different blockchain networks
- Tracks the flow of data from Lisk to Zama and back
- Ensures message delivery and processing across chains
- Provides real-time visibility into cross-chain operations

### 2. Message Validation and Verification
- Validates the authenticity of cross-chain messages
- Verifies message signatures and cryptographic proofs
- Ensures message integrity during transmission
- Detects and reports any message tampering or failures

### 3. Status Tracking and Reporting
- Maintains comprehensive logs of all cross-chain activities
- Provides status updates for ongoing operations
- Generates reports on cross-chain performance metrics
- Offers debugging information for troubleshooting

### 4. Error Detection and Recovery
- Identifies failed cross-chain message deliveries
- Implements retry mechanisms for failed operations
- Provides alerts for critical failures
- Assists in recovery procedures when needed
